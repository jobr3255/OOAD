[Project 1](Project1/README.md)

### Compiling and unning projects
You can easily run each project from the root directory by running the project.sh script and pass in the number of which project you want to run.
```
./project.sh PROJECT_NUMBER
```
You can also compile and/or run project separately using the -c and -r flags.
```
./project.sh PROJECT_NUMBER -c
./project.sh PROJECT_NUMBER -r
```
You can use the -o flag to pipe the output to a specified file.
```
./project.sh PROJECT_NUMBER -o FILE_NAME
```
You can also use the -h flag for more help.
```
./project.sh -h
```
